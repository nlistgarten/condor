    dot - derivative of state with respect to indepdnent variable, purely a function of

    set it with `make` field -- all controls MUST be set? or default to 0.

    fact how simupy implements it. maybe convert output to a freefield that takes an
    expression (like constraint, I guess?) and then "make" is only in mode and adds
    conditional behavior -- defaults to value from creation?

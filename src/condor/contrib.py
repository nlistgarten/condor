    parameter - auxilary variables (constant-in-time) that determine system behavior

    state - fully defines evolution of system driven by ODEs

    dot - derivative of state with respect to indepdnent variable, purely a function of
    state, independent_variable, parameters
    [DAE version will have a residual associated with state differential]

    output - dynamic output at particular state and value of independent variable
    (point-wise in independent variable)

    control - time-varying placeholder, useful for re-defining using mode, etc.
    set it with `make` field -- all controls MUST be set? or default to 0.

    needs control/subsitution -- I guess what I'm calling "control" is really an
    (explicit) algebraic state? I guess this is really the same as an "output" and is in
    fact how simupy implements it. maybe convert output to a freefield that takes an
    expression (like constraint, I guess?) and then "make" is only in mode and adds
    conditional behavior -- defaults to value from creation?

    then keep control field but only for open loop control? not sure, but some way to
    mark an output as a control signal

    don't include specialty types like discrete control, etc? user must know that for
    discrete time signal it requires state with dot=0 and update

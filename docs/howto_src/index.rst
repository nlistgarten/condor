    :maxdepth: 1

    table_basics
    parallel_processing

..
   parallel_processing - quick guide on parallel processing

   optimization_callback
       from_values - or part of callback?
   pareto_front - using a constraint to sweep?
   set_initial - set initial for iterative solvers

   variable -- warmstart, initializer, etc.

   options (or to topic) -- inspect implementation, basic usage and philosophy? so actually topic
   how to access model metadata

   how to dry-up 
   alias_dict - use dictionaries for manging IO
   functions operating on fields

   model_generators - not sure what this was for? maybe just a header for the two below??
   functional_class_factory - using metaprogramming machinery in a function
   configuration_class_factory - using configuration to make a dynamic model
      dynamic link?

   new_model_template -- 
     extend existing model with pre-populated fields/using placeholders
     Defining fields/creating new fields
     Creating a new implementaiton vs using existing

   new_solver -- create new implementation to re-route ?? :(
